##  📖 About

This is a collection of small and focused instances - each covering a single and well defined approach in the area of the java application development grouped by modules. Each module is supposed to provide a separate simple instance. 
In this project each module presents a small simple instance of the updating approaches and technologies for the `spring-boot` service.
A strong focus of these is, of course, the different updating approaches of the `spring-boot` RESTful API.

### Modules

This project includes the follows modules:

- [option-field-approach](option-field-approach/README.md) - this module is a simple `spring-boot` RESTful API which provides the update operation for the updating `person` entities via jackson `DTO` serialization/deserialisation; **This instance  is listening on port `8081`;**

## 🎚 Features

- The simple RESTful API which provides the update operations for the updating `person` entities via jackson `DTO` serialization/deserialisation.

## 🚦 Getting Started

These instructions allow to get a copy of this project and run it on a local machine. 

### Prerequisites

Before using it, make sure that follows software are installed on the local machine:

- **[Oracle JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)** -  java development kit;
- **[Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/)** - dependency management;

If any of the listed software is not installed, then it can be installed by instruction as described below.

1. #### Oracle JDK 8+

   - Install Oracle JDK 8+ according to instructions from an [official](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) instruction.

2. #### Maven 3+

   - Install Maven 3+ according to instructions from an [official](https://maven.apache.org/) source.


### Installing

In order to install it is quite simple to clone or download this repository.

### Cloning

For the cloning this repository to a local machine, just use the follows link:

```http
https://github.com/ololx/restful-updating-instances
```

### Using

To use it is necessary to:
1 - Build the project.
2 - Launch the instances.
3 - Send http request

### Building the project

To do the full build, execute maven goal `install` in the root directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Building a single module

To do the full build, execute maven goal `install` in the module directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Launching in command line

To do the run examples, execute maven goal `spring-boot:run` in the module directory by the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Launching in IDE

This is a multi-module project. Each model is supposed to provide a separate example. 
That's why when  you're working with an individual module, there's no need to import all of them (or build all of them) - you can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse, NetBeanse or IntelliJ IDEA and run each example  in IDE.

### Sending http request

Just open `swagger` form using this link:

```http
http://localhost:{port-of-module}/swagger-ui.html
```
